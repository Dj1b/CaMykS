    Regardless of the efforts made, no method of Internet transmission and no method of electronic storage is completely secure. Consequently, we cannot guarantee absolute security. If we become aware of a breach of security, we shall inform the <span class="eContent2">Users</span> concerned in order that they may take the appropriate measures. Our procedures for notifying incidents take account of our legal obligations, both national and European. We undertake to inform our clients in full of all questions concerning the security of their account, and to give them all necessary information to assist them to meet their own statutory obligations in respect of reporting.

Only in the event that <?= $this->contentItem->get_editorFullName(); ?> and its rights are purchased would the said data be permitted to be transferred to the putative purchaser, which would in its turn be bound by the same obligation of conservation and modification of the <span class="eContent2">Personal Data</span> towards the <span class="eContent2">User</span> of the Site <?= $this->contentItem->get_websiteURL(); ?>.
