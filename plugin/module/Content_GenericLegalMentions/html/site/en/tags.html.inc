<h2 class="eTitle2">
    10. Internet tags
</h2>

<p class="eContent1">
    <?= ucfirst($this->contentItem->get_editorFullName()); ?> may occasionally use Internet tags (also called action tags, single-pixel GIFs, transparent GIFs, invisible GIFs or one-to-one GIFs), and deploy them through a specialist Web analytics partner, which may be located (and therefore store the corresponding data, including the <span class="eContent2">User</span>'s IP address) in a foreign country.
</p>

<p class="eContent1">
    These tags are placed both in online advertisements enabling Web surfers to access the <span class="eContent2">Website</span>, and on various pages of the <span class="eContent2">Website</span>.
</p>

<p class="eContent1">
    This technology enables <?= $this->contentItem->get_editorFullName(); ?> to assess visitors' responses when they visit the <span class="eContent2">Website</span>, and the effectiveness of its actions (for example, the number of times a page is opened and the data viewed), and also how this <span class="eContent2">Website</span> is used by the <span class="eContent2">User</span>.
</p>

<p class="eContent1">
    The outside service-provider may possibly collect data concerning visitors to the <span class="eContent2">Website</span> and other websites using these tags, produce reports on the <span class="eContent2">Website</span>'s activity for the attention of <?= $this->contentItem->get_editorFullName(); ?>, and provide other services relating to use of the <span class="eContent2">Website</span> and of the Internet.
